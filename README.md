# Data Preprocessing
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Data preprocessing can refer to manipulation or dropping of data before it is used in order to ensure or enhance performance and is an important step in the data mining process.
Analyzing data that has not been carefully screened for such problems can produce misleading results. Thus, the representation and quality of data is first and foremost before running any analysis.
So in this segment we would tend to preprocess a dataset of a campaign research of a company</p>
<h2>Procedure of Duty</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <h3>Data Preparation</h3> 
    The data file bank.csv used in this experiment is a modified version of the Bank
    Marketing dataset, which is the data set related with direct marketing campaigns of a
    Portuguese banking institution. The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. 
    Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, in order to access if the 
    product (bank term deposit) would be ('yes') or not ('no') subscribed. The original dataset 
    was created/donated to UCI repository by Moro et al. (2014) (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/
    ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing).

    <h3>Data Exploration</h3>
    From this section, we would figure out the relationship between pair-to-pair features of data and get descrision.
    In which, the first work was dectect the distribution of 3 distinct types of data, including nominal, ordinal and numerical values.
    The second work would be comparisions between 3 pairs of feature in order to figure out the relation and assiciation of each pair of dataset. 
    Finally, with 3 different features of dataset, we would group out the value of it and get out explanation for the reseaching.
  </li>

    <h3>Dealing With Missing Data</h3>
    For the dataset, the information maybe not too reasonable for running any learning process due to the insufficient values, which problem would be address from this process.
    Particularly, the missing data, as well as nan values would be replace by mutilple ways and one of which was replacing with the mean or median of numerical data.
